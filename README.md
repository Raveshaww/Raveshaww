Sysadmin with an interest in Ansible, Kubernetes, cloud engineering and IaC. 

My repos are a mix of my notes on miscellaneous topics, as well as useful bits of code from whatever I happen to be working on in my personal time. I hope they are helpful!

Currently working through a degree, so updates are not likely to be coming in the immediate future.
